## How to run
```
# Retrieve city location data and store them into a static file
npm run prebuild

# Run server - either of below
npm run start 
npx expo start

# Run test - it will generate test coverage into ./coverage  
npm test
```

## How to build
```
eas login

# Generate .apk / .aab for Android
eas build --platform android

# Generate .ipa for iOS
eas build --platform ios

```

## Requirements
- [x] Show the current weather based on the user's location.
- [x] Show a list of available locations to choose from.
- [ ] Handle no internet connection/failure to get api response.
- [x] UI to illustrate a few weather conditions (sun, rain, snow, etc).

## Key points of implementation
### 1. API call optimization via SWR with key based caching
Weather data is fetched using SWR, with each request has city coordinates as a key. This enables automatic response caching and revalidation.
When a previously selected city is revisited, SWR serves the cached data instantly without triggering new API requests, improving performance and user experience.

### 2. Global state persistence using `async-storage` + `zustand`
Application state (selected city in this case) is managed through a zustand store, and persisted using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.
This setup ensures consistent state across sessions and components without passing it as a params.
`zustand` handles complex state objects and simplifies state organization and promotes readability.

### 3. Pre-Build static generation of city coordinate data
Since geographic coordinates for cities are static not the same like weather data, they are retrieved at build time via the [Open-Meteo Geocoding API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api) and stored in a local JSON file.
This eliminates the need for runtime geolocation API calls.
For adding new selectable cities, it only requires updating the `constants/Cities.ts`.
